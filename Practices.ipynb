    "### Question 1\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine whether some anagram of `t` is a substring of `s`. For example: if `s = \"udacity\"` and `t = \"ad\"`, then the function returns `True`. Your function definition should look like: `question1(s, t)` and return a boolean `True` or `False`.\n",

Take the string \"abbdbbb\" as an example, if we are given index 2, say b here, its left is \"b\" and right is \"d\", then it's not a parlindrome. But if we are given index 3, say d here, its 1st left is \"b\" and 1st right \"b\", and \"bdb\" is a parlindrome. We continue to check its 2nd left and 2nd right, say \"b\" and \"b\" here, again \"bbdbb\" is a parlindrome. We keep check its 3rd left and 3rd right, say \"a\" and \"b\" here, this time, we get two different letters. Then the longest parlindrome for a give position, index 2, here, is \"bbdbb\", with a length of 5. We can do a loop for each letter in our string and finally find the longest parlindrome."
